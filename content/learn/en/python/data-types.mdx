## What are data types anyway?

Data must have types so the language can distinguish between them. For example, there might be numbers. So the language needs to distinguish to know how to handle these numbers. And there must be a data type for the language to know how to handle written text.
Like for example in the introduction when you created a variable `name` and set it to `"Maged"`. We will now see these types together.

## Int

Int is an integer. Like in math, numbers -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, and so on.
Python handles integers when you write them like this:

```python
age = 16 # Notice I wrote the number normally
```

# Mathematical Operations

We can also perform mathematical operations like addition and subtraction.

```python
balance = 350
cost = 100
balance_after_purchase = balance - cost
print(balance_after_purchase) # Try printing it yourself and see what happens
balance_after_refund = balance_after_purchase + cost
print(balance_after_refund)
```

```python
number_of_item = 3
cost = 100
total_cost = number_of_item * cost # We use the asterisk to multiply numbers
print(total_cost)

cost_of_one_item = total_cost / number_of_item # We use the slash (/) to divide
print(cost_of_one_item)
```

## Float

Float is used for decimal numbers. Like 1.5, 3.14, 2.71, etc...

```python
pi = 3.14
print(pi)
```

If you want the language to treat the number as a float even if it's not a fraction initially, you must write it with a decimal point after it.

```python
cost = 100.0
print(cost)
```

Of course, you can perform mathematical operations on it just like Int, normally.

# String

String is text. It can be a name, address, or anything that is text.

```python
name = "Maged"
print(name)
```

## Operations on String

You can normally add and multiply strings together. But you cannot subtract or divide them.

```python
address_one = "Fake Street"
address_two = "321"
full_address = address_one + " " + address_two # I added a space so they don't stick together
print(full_address) # Try printing without the space
```

```python
symbol = "#"
print(symbol * 10)
```

Try putting numbers in quotation marks and add them.
```python
print("1" + "2")
```
It will print `12` because it's a string, It won't print `3` as in numbers

# Boolean

Boolean type has only two values: `True` and `False`. It is often used in conditions.
Note that the first letter must be capitalized.

```python
is_logged_in = True
has_permission = False
```
