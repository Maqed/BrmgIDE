## What is Python?

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It's perfect for beginners and powerful enough for professionals. Python uses indentation to define code blocks, making it clean and easy to read.

## Variables and Data Types

In Python, you don't need to declare variable types explicitly. Python automatically determines the type based on the value assigned.

```python
# Numbers
age = 25
price = 19.99

# Strings
name = "Alice"
message = 'Hello, World!'

# Booleans
is_active = True
has_permission = False

# Lists (arrays)
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

# Dictionaries (key-value pairs)
person = {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}
```

## Basic Operations

```python
# Arithmetic operations
result = 10 + 5      # Addition: 15
result = 10 - 5      # Subtraction: 5
result = 10 * 5      # Multiplication: 50
result = 10 / 5      # Division: 2.0
result = 10 // 3     # Floor division: 3
result = 10 % 3      # Modulus: 1
result = 2 ** 3      # Exponentiation: 8

# String operations
greeting = "Hello" + " " + "World"  # Concatenation
repeated = "Hi" * 3                  # Repetition: "HiHiHi"
```

## Conditional Statements

Python uses `if`, `elif`, and `else` for conditional logic. Remember to indent the code blocks!

```python
age = 18

if age < 13:
    print("You are a child")
elif age < 18:
    print("You are a teenager")
else:
    print("You are an adult")

# Comparison operators
x = 10
if x > 5 and x < 15:
    print("x is between 5 and 15")

# Checking if value exists
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
if "apple" in fruits:
    print("Apple is in the list")
```

## Loops

### For Loops

```python
# Loop through a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# Loop through a range of numbers
for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # Prints 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

# Loop with start and end
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)  # Prints 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

# Loop with step
for i in range(0, 10, 2):
    print(i)  # Prints 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
```

### While Loops

```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1  # Increment by 1

# Break and continue
i = 0
while i < 10:
    i += 1
    if i == 3:
        continue  # Skip this iteration
    if i == 7:
        break     # Exit the loop
    print(i)
```

## Functions

Functions help you organize and reuse code. Use the `def` keyword to define a function.

```python
# Simple function
def greet():
    print("Hello!")

greet()  # Call the function

# Function with parameters
def greet_person(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet_person("Alice")

# Function with return value
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add(5, 3)  # result = 8

# Function with default parameters
def greet_with_title(name, title="Mr."):
    return f"Hello, {title} {name}"

print(greet_with_title("Smith"))              # Hello, Mr. Smith
print(greet_with_title("Jones", "Dr."))       # Hello, Dr. Jones
```

## Input and Output

```python
# Print to console
print("Hello, World!")
print("Age:", 25)
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old")  # f-strings

# Get user input
name = input("What is your name? ")
age = input("How old are you? ")
age = int(age)  # Convert string to integer
```

## Lists and Basic Operations

```python
# Create a list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Access elements
first = numbers[0]      # First element: 1
last = numbers[-1]      # Last element: 5

# Add elements
numbers.append(6)       # Add to end: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
numbers.insert(0, 0)    # Insert at position: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Remove elements
numbers.remove(3)       # Remove value 3
last = numbers.pop()    # Remove and return last element

# List length
length = len(numbers)   # Get number of elements

# Slicing
subset = numbers[1:4]   # Get elements from index 1 to 3
```

## Comments

```python
# This is a single-line comment

"""
This is a multi-line comment
or docstring. It can span
multiple lines.
"""

# Use comments to explain your code
def calculate_area(radius):
    # Calculate the area of a circle
    pi = 3.14159
    return pi * radius ** 2
```
