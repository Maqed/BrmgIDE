## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a versatile language primarily used for web development to create interactive websites. It can also be used for server-side development (Node.js), mobile applications, and more.

## So, what are the basics?

In this introduction, we will learn the simplest things. How to create a variable and log it to the console.

```javascript
let username = "Maged";
console.log(username);
```

Try changing the value inside `name` to your own name and run it yourself in the code editor (IDE) or your browser's console.
