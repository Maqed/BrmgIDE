# What are data types anyway?

Data must have types so the language can distinguish between them. For example, there might be numbers. So the language needs to distinguish to know how to handle these numbers. And there must be a data type for the language to know how to handle written text.
Like for example in the introduction when you created a variable `username` and set it to `"Maged"`. We will now see these types together.

# Number

In JavaScript, there is no distinction between Int (integers) and Float (decimals) like in some other languages. All numbers are just `Number` type.

```javascript
let age = 16; // Integer
let price = 19.99; // Decimal
```

## Mathematical Operations

We can also perform mathematical operations like addition and subtraction.

```javascript
let balance = 350;
let cost = 100;
let balance_after_purchase = balance - cost;
console.log(balance_after_purchase); // Try printing it yourself and see what happens
let balance_after_refund = balance_after_purchase + cost;
console.log(balance_after_refund);
```

```javascript
let number_of_item = 3;
let cost = 100;
let total_cost = number_of_item * cost; // We use the asterisk to multiply numbers
console.log(total_cost);

let cost_of_one_item = total_cost / number_of_item; // We use the slash (/) to divide
console.log(cost_of_one_item);
```

# String

String is text. It can be a name, address, or anything that is text.

```javascript
let username = "Maged";
console.log(username);
```

## Operations on String

You can normally add strings together (concatenation).

```javascript
let address_one = "Fake Street";
let address_two = "321";
let full_address = address_one + " " + address_two; // I added a space so they don't stick together
console.log(full_address); // Try printing without the space
```

Try putting numbers in quotation marks and add them.

```javascript
console.log("1" + "2");
```

It will print `12` because it's a string, It won't print `3` as in numbers.
